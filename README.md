# Guessing-Game

This app plays a guessing game with the user using a random number between 1 and 100. 
Each wrong answer produces a random hint and reduces the user's score by 10. 
The user will have 10 chances to guess before game over. 

Feel free to copy from this and use in you own programs. Let me know if there are questions or ideas to improve.
